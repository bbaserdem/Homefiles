# EWW configuration

My personal `eww` configuration.

[The main config file](eww.yuck) contains common config to all desktops.
Specific widgets and bar are in the desktops' respective folder.

# BSPWM

[`bspwm`](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) is my X desktop of choice.

# River

[`river`](https://github.com/riverwm/river) is my Wayland desktop of choice.

# Layout

* Each full widget gets it's own folder.
* All scripts are in the [scripts](./scripts) subdirectory.
* All scripts are prefixed by the desktop or app they are to be used with.
